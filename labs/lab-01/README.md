# Lab 01 – Reflections on HTML

## What I Learned
In this lab I was introduced to the basics of HTML, which is the standard markup language for creating webpages.  
I learned about the basic structure of an HTML document, including:

- `<!DOCTYPE html>` to tell the browser the document type.
- `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` as the main sections.
- How to include metadata inside the `<head>` and visible content inside the `<body>`.

## Key Takeaways
- HTML provides the **skeleton** of a webpage.  
- Tags like `<h1>`, `<p>`, and `<a>` help organize and link content.  
- HTML is not about styling (that’s CSS), but about giving **meaning and structure** to text.  
- Simple pages (like our root `index.html`) can be made with just a few lines of HTML.

## Reflection
At first HTML felt very minimal, but I realized that even the most advanced websites start with this same basic structure.  
I also understood that HTML by itself doesn’t make pages look attractive — it just lays out the elements.  
Going forward, I’m curious how HTML combines with CSS and JavaScript to make interactive and styled webpages.
