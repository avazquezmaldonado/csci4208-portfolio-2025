# Lab 04 – JavaScript Guessing Game

### What I Built
In this lab I built an interactive number-guessing game using JavaScript.  
The player tries to guess a randomly generated number, and the game provides feedback such as “too high” or “too low.”  
This was one of my first projects using JavaScript functions, variables, loops, and conditional logic to control the browser.

### What Was Tricky
The most challenging part was connecting the JavaScript logic to the HTML elements so the game could update messages and images in real time.  
Another difficult part was debugging input validation and making sure the program handled non-numeric or empty guesses correctly.  
I also had to make sure the game could reset between rounds without reloading the entire page.

### What I’d Improve
If I were to improve the lab, I would:
- Add a counter that tracks how many guesses the player has made.  
- Include simple animations or sound effects when the player wins or loses.  
- Keep a high-score tracker using `localStorage` so results persist between sessions.  
- Make the layout more responsive for smaller screens.

Overall, this lab helped me understand how DOM manipulation and event listeners make a static webpage interactive.
