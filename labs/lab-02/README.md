# Lab 02 – Reflections on CSS

## What I Learned
In this lab I was introduced to Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and how they control the look and feel of a webpage.  
I learned about:
- How to link an external CSS file to an HTML page using `<link rel="stylesheet">`.
- The difference between inline styles, internal styles (`<style>` in the HTML), and external stylesheets.
- Basic CSS syntax: selectors, properties, and values (e.g., `p { color: blue; }`).

## Key Takeaways
- CSS separates **content (HTML)** from **presentation (styles)**, making webpages easier to manage.
- Classes (`.classname`) and IDs (`#idname`) allow targeted styling of elements.
- The “cascading” part of CSS means that styles can override each other depending on specificity and order.
- CSS improves readability and professionalism of even simple HTML pages.

## Reflection
At first, I thought HTML alone was enough, but now I understand that CSS is what makes websites visually appealing and user-friendly.  
Experimenting with colors, fonts, and layout showed me how small changes can completely transform a webpage.  
I also realized how important it is to keep CSS organized, especially when projects get bigger.  
This lab gave me the foundation to make my portfolio pages look cleaner and more engaging.
