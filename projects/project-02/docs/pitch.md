# Pitch

**Track:** Productivity  
**App name:** TaskTrack  

TaskTrack is a small local-first task tracker. It lets users add and complete tasks directly in the browser, saving progress to localStorage so nothing is lost when reloading.  
A short analytics page shows totals and lets the user save a simple summary to JSONBin as cloud backup.

The goal is to practice browser-side state management, REST requests (GET and PUT), and local persistence.
