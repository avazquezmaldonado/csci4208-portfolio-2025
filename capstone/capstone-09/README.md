# Final Demo & Deployment — capstone-09

**Team repo:** https://github.com/avazquezmaldonado/CardMatch  
**Project (v2) board:** https://github.com/avazquezmaldonado/CardMatch/projects  
**Live demo / recording (if applicable):** TBD (deployment pending)

## Deliverables for this phase
- Complete application deployment
- Final demonstration and walkthrough
- Comprehensive documentation
- Project reflection and lessons learned

## Summary (what we produced)
This is it - the final push to get everything deployed and demo-ready. CardMatch is working end-to-end now. Users can input their profile and spending, get personalized card recommendations with rewards estimates, and see which cards they're eligible for.

Planning to deploy the frontend on Netlify or GitHub Pages and the backend on Render. Need to do final testing in the production environment to make sure everything connects properly. Also putting together a demo video showing the full workflow.

## Evidence / Artifacts
- [Final Demo Document](https://github.com/avazquezmaldonado/CardMatch/blob/main/docs/capstone-09-final-demo.md)
- Live application (coming soon)
- Demo recording
- All documentation in `/docs`
- [Implementation Summary](https://github.com/avazquezmaldonado/CardMatch/blob/main/IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md)
- [Final Checklist](https://github.com/avazquezmaldonado/CardMatch/blob/main/FINAL_CHECKLIST.md)

## Notes & Risks
Deployment is the last hurdle. Need to configure environment variables correctly and make sure the frontend can hit the backend API once they're on different domains. Should be straightforward but always something that can go wrong. After deployment, will do one more round of testing to catch any issues that only show up in production.
