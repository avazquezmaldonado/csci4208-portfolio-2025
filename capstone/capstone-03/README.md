# Frontend Design — capstone-03

**Team repo:** https://github.com/avazquezmaldonado/CardMatch  
**Project (v2) board:** https://github.com/avazquezmaldonado/CardMatch/projects  
**Live demo / recording (if applicable):** N/A (design phase)

## Deliverables for this phase
- UI mockups and wireframes
- Screen flow and navigation design
- Component architecture
- CSS styling plan

## Summary (what we produced)
For the frontend, I sketched out what the UI should look like and how users would move through the app. Started with some basic mockups showing the profile form, spending input section, and results display. Nothing fancy - just clean and functional.

I planned out the component structure even though I'm using vanilla JS. The idea is to keep things modular so I can reuse form components and keep the code organized. The design doc shows the flow from entering your info to seeing your recommended cards.

## Evidence / Artifacts

- UI mockups and flow diagrams
- Component structure notes

## Notes & Risks
I'm keeping the UI pretty simple on purpose - don't want to get bogged down in complex styling when the main goal is functionality. That said, I do need to make sure forms are easy to fill out and that validation feedback is clear. Mobile view is something I'll need to test but shouldn't be too hard with some basic responsive CSS.
