# Planning & Specification — capstone-02

**Team repo:** https://github.com/avazquezmaldonado/CardMatch  
**Project (v2) board:** https://github.com/avazquezmaldonado/CardMatch/projects  
**Live demo / recording (if applicable):** N/A (planning phase)

## Deliverables for this phase
- User stories with acceptance criteria
- Feature breakdown (frontend, backend, data layers)
- System behavior specifications
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies

## Summary (what we produced)
This phase was all about getting my ideas organized. I wrote out user stories to capture what someone would actually want to do with CardMatch - like entering their spending habits and getting card recommendations that make sense for them. Breaking down the features into frontend, backend, and data pieces helped me see how everything would connect.

The planning doc covers the main user flows and what needs to happen behind the scenes to make recommendations work. I also mapped out potential problems early - things like keeping the scope manageable and handling weird edge cases in spending data.

## Evidence / Artifacts
- [Planning Document](https://github.com/avazquezmaldonado/CardMatch/blob/main/docs/capstone-02-planning.md)
- User stories with acceptance criteria
- Feature breakdown by layer

## Notes & Risks
Honestly, scope creep is my biggest worry here. There are so many cool features I could add, but I need to stay focused on the core functionality first. Also, validating spending data properly is going to take some thought - people might enter their spending in unexpected ways.
