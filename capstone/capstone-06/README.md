# Client Audit — capstone-06

**Team repo:** https://github.com/avazquezmaldonado/CardMatch  
**Project (v2) board:** https://github.com/avazquezmaldonado/CardMatch/projects  
**Live demo / recording (if applicable):** N/A (audit phase)

## Deliverables for this phase
- Frontend implementation walkthrough
- UI/UX testing and validation
- Component integration verification
- Client-side data flow analysis

## Summary (what we produced)
Time to look at what I actually built on the frontend and see if it matches the design. Went through the UI testing different scenarios - filling out forms with various inputs, checking if validation messages show up correctly, making sure the results display makes sense.

Tested on Chrome and Firefox to catch any browser quirks. Checked how data flows from form inputs through to API calls. Found a few spots where the UX could be smoother and made notes for improvements.

## Evidence / Artifacts
- [Client Audit Document](https://github.com/avazquezmaldonado/CardMatch/blob/main/docs/capstone-06-client-audit.md)
- Frontend code in `/frontend` folder
- Testing notes and screenshots

## Notes & Risks
The UI works pretty well overall. Had to fix a couple validation edge cases I didn't think of initially. Performance is good - page loads fast and interactions feel snappy. Could probably improve accessibility more if I had extra time, but basic keyboard navigation and labels are in place.
